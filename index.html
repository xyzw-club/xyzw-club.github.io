<section id="about">
<p><b>XYZW Club</b> is a lunchtime get-together for people to learn and play with all things 3d-rendered.</p>
<p>Some of the things we're thinking of covering:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Writing a simple software 3d engine</li>
  <li>Simple maths behind 3d transforms and projection</li>
  <li>Getting started with WebGL</li>
  <li>Raytracing and raymarching</li>
  <li>Deferred rendering pipelines</li>
  <li>Physically-based rendering</li>
  <li>And more...</li>
</ul>
<p>This is absolutely not an expert group. Come along to learn, to teach, to play with a different
set of programs and problems than you get in your day job, or just to eat your lunch.</p>
