<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s of primary importance that everyone who wants to participate feels safe and welcome. When participating in XYZW Club, either online or offline, in the meeting venue or at the pub afterwards, we expect you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>behave respectfully towards other people — they&rsquo;re real humans, just like you</li>
  <li>be considerate of people&rsquo;s time and attention</li>
  <li>contribute positively and constructively to discussions (online or in-person)</li>
</ul>

<p>On the mailing list, we want to maintain a high signal-to-noise ratio and while the organisers will step in as soon as they see poor behaviour, we encourage you to say something if you see it first. So please:</p>

<ul>
  <li>lead by example — if a discussion is devolving into snark and name-calling, either let it die or raise the tone</li>
  <li>keep standards high — if someone acts disrespectfully, make that crystal clear to them</li>
</ul>

<h3>Incident Handling</h3>
<p>We want everyone to feel welcome at XYZW Club, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. Accordingly, we will not tolerate harassment of our members in any form; not at the meetings, not at the pub after the meetings, or any other XYZW Club social meeting; not on Twitter or on any other online media.</p> 
<p>Harassment includes invasions of personal space, exclusionary jokes/comments, and sexual language and imagery in meetings, but this list is non-exhaustive: if you make anyone feel uncomfortable or unwelcome, you will be asked to leave.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re still in need of clarification, there are <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/codeofconduct/">a number</a> of <a href="http://theangryblackwoman.com/2009/10/01/the-dos-and-donts-of-being-a-good-ally/">good</a> resources <a href="http://www.shakesville.com/2010/01/feminism-101.html">online</a> which we encourage you read. The main thing to remember though, is that if someone feels harassed or excluded by your words or actions, then those words or actions constitute harassment or exclusion. Your intent is not a factor.</p>

<p>All XYZW Club participants are accountable for their own behaviour. If you&rsquo;ve behaved badly elsewhere, that may count against you here, because of the effect it has on other attendees.</p>

<p>If you experience or witness any harassing behaviour, please report it to a member of the volunteer team.</p>
