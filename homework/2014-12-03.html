<h2>Homework</h2>

<p>
The code is on <a href="https://github.com/xyzw-club/softwareRenderer">github</a> and you'll need to check it out and serve the pages with your webserver of choice, something like this should do it:
</p>

<pre>
  $ git clone https://github.com/xyzw-club/softwareRenderer.git
  $ cd softwareRenderer
  $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
</pre>
